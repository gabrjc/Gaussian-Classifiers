# Gaussian-Classifiers
Iris Dataset classification task with Gaussian Classifiers.<br/><br/>
***No ML Library, only low level algorithms.***

## List of classifiers:
1. Multivariate Gaussian Classifer
2. Naive Bayes Gaussian Classifer
3. Tied Covariance Gaussian Classifer
4. Tied Naive Bayes Classifier<br/>

## Evaluation:
- On the first iteration the classifiers are used with 2/3 as training set and 1/3 as evaluation set.
- On the second iteration the classifiers are applied with leave one out approach and the global accuracy is calculated as mean of all evaluation results.<br/>

### No matrix has been mistreated to make this software but handle with care and awareness.
